    <string name="ulo_about">The University of London Observatory is a hands-on teaching observatory and is part of the Astrophysics Group at UCLs Department of Physics and Astronomy."\n\n"
We are equipped with five permanently mounted telescopes, two computer classrooms and a specialist astronomy library. Our reasonable proximity to the main campus, and the provision of regular classes, ensure that students have good access to the telescopes."\n\n"
In addition to observing, students are trained in data-reduction techniques, the practical applications of astrophysical theory, and computational astronomy. This training can take place in the context of an undergraduate degree module, a student project, or, for interested members of the public, as part of our further-education Certifcate in Astronomy."\n\n"
ULO remains active in scientific inquiry, with a strong observational research programme in extrasolar planets. We are in the process of expanding our observing capabilities with the development of unattended (remote and robotic) observing modes, which we hope will culminate in a new large robotic telescope, a project for which funding is currently underway."\n\n"
We offer guided tours to the public (booking required), and are actively engaged in outreach activities to schools. We are honoured to be affiliated to the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers.</string>
	<string name="ulo_address_title">Address</string>
    <string name="ulo_address">University of London Observatory"\n"553 Watford Way"\n"Mill Hill Park"\n"London"\n"NW7 2QS</string>
    <string name="ulo_finding_title">Finding ULO</string>
    <string name="ulo_finding">The Observatory is located off the northbound carriageway of the A1 in Mill Hill, North London. (There is no vehicular access from the southbound carriageway; pedestrians on the southbound side of the road must use the under-road subway just north of the Observatory.) It is easily reached by public transport."\n\n"
We discourage arrival by car; entry to the site from the Watford Way is hazardous, and there is no parking for tour visitors on site. A large, free public car park is located nearby Daws Lane (postcode for satnav is NW7 4SL. The route to ULO is via the A1 pedestrian underpass, most easily reached from the alley that runs along the western side of Royal Mail Mill Hill Delivery Office). Parking is also available in the Mill Hill Broadway railway-station car park in Bunns Lane (pay and display, but free after 18:30)."\n\n"
Disabled visitors should contact us in advance to enquire about access; note that the site is not wheelchair-friendly, and has steep stairways.</string>

    <string name="event_content1">The close historical association between astronomy and timekeeping has been recognized by an invitation of affiliation from the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers
The affiliation was formally marked on 2013 January 24 at ULO, when the Master of the Clockmakers, Mark Elliott, presented the Clockmakers Shield of Arms to the President and Provost of UCL, Professor Malcolm Grant. We look forward to a long and fruitful relationship.</string>
    <string name="event_content2">The Observatory is developing the capability of operating suitable telescopes from off-site, a process initially made possible by a CIF grant allowing purchase of equipment enabling a dome to track the motion of the telescope it houses. Over the summer months a concerted and continuing effort has been made by Observatory staff to tackle remaining mechanical and software challenges, with undergraduate involvement made possible through bursaries provided by the Nuffield Trust and the Royal Astronomical Society.
A milestone in this process was passed on 2010 July 21, when student Jakub Bochinski controlled a C14 telescope and its CCD camera from his home in central London, using a web-based interface â€“ the first remote observation to be conducted at ULO. As well as calibration frames, a set of first light images of the planetary nebula M27, shown below, was obtained.
A number of operational matters have yet to be resolved, and routine remote observing still lies well ahead. Nonetheless, the success of this experiment, attributable to the combined efforts of all the technical and academic staff at the Observatory, demonstrates great promise for future progress in this direction.</string>
    <string name="event_content3">What happens when art and astronomy meet? Artist Katie Paterson has joined UCLs Astrophysics Group as their first Artist in Residence, thanks to a grant from the Leverhulme Trust. During the residency, Katie will investigate ideas of Ancient Darkness and Early Light in the Universe, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, and very distant objects, and create a new body of artwork alongside her findings. Katie graduated from the UCL Slade School of Fine Art in 2007.
The following video, which includes much footage obtained at ULO, outlines some of the concepts and ideas.</string>
